trying to implement recursion and stack concepts with a cool concept. <br><br>
running sandpile.py allows users to customize the array size and sandpile limit on console. <br><br>
tests are included for inner functions: array indexing and stack functions. <br><br>
I'm currently working on visualizing the array with pygame, since everything is running on console. <br><br>
